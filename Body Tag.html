  1.	To investigate double pipe heat exchanger using wire coil inserts.
2.	To improve the heat transfer enhancement many possible techniques were employed to enhance performance.
3.	On short length tape with different modified twisted tape offered better heat enhancement that twisted tape inserts.
4.	It can be concluded that heat transfer rate increases with using augmentation(wire coil insets with twisted tape) as well as friction factor increases. All those lead to increase the pumping power.
